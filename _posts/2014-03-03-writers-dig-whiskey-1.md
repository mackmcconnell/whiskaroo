### Dorothy Parker

Dorothy Parker was an Americain poet, short-story writer, critic, satirist and screenwriter. Although her sucesses include two Academy Awards nominations, her involvement in left-wing politics led her to the famous Hollywood blacklist of Senator Joe McCarthy of Wisconsin.

Her taste for alcohol is said to come from an unhappy childhood and several failed marriages. Despite that being a pretty sad reason to become a whiskey fan, she remained a vibrant, independent spirit until her death. She couldn't stand, in her words, to have put "all her eggs in one bastard".

One of her most famous poems speaks about her taste for whiskey and love of independance:
> #####I wish I could drink like a lady
> #####I can take one or two at the most
> #####Three and I'm under the table
> #####Four and I'm under the host
