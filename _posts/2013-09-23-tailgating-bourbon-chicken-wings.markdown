It's tailgating time and we've got the perfect pairing of bourbon and wings for your next big game. These Smoked Honey Bourbon Chicken Wings will disappear before you know it. Not down to smoke the wings? Just make the Barbecue sauce and use it for pretty much anything. You'll love it's rich flavor and sweetness with a little kick of bourbon. 

We got this recipe from the awesome guys over at Extraordinary BBQ, and they didn't disappoint. When we made this recipe people were shocked how simple it was AND that the sauce was homemade. Who said guys can't cook?

And, don't worry dudes, you don't need to bust out the stuff off the top shelf for this one. Any kind of bourbon should do the trick. Keep the good stuff for drinking!
