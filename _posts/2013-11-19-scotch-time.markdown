<!-- They say every dog has it's day, and right now it seems like it's time for Scotch to shine. 

With a multitude of different varieties, years of aging and it's growing popularity with a younger generation, it is currently one of the hottest drinks out there. Just try getting your hands on a bottle of Pappy Van Winkle! 

With the love of unique, small batch offerings, many people are turning to new, standout scotches as their drink of choice no matter what festive event is taking place. While the shortage may take place in a few years, because of the aging process, as for now, enjoy.

###5 interesting facts that will make you sound like you know a thing or two about Scotch.

> 1. ####Scotch Whiskey, in it's beginning forms, is a distilled beer.

> 2. ####Scotch whisky is a very important industry to Scotland!
