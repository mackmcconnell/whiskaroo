This Pumpkin Spice Milkshake is perfect for the Holiday season, starting with Halloween and going all the way through Christmas. With the addition of  Breckenridge Bourbon, it will take the edge off of any event you may have to attend. Share it with your friends and family, or keep the goodness all to yourself, it's up to you!

We used the October Bourbon of the Month, Breckenridge Bourbon, from the highest distillery in America. This perfectly smokey bourbon with a hint of cinnamon adds the right amount spice to make the milkshake go down just like a pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving.
