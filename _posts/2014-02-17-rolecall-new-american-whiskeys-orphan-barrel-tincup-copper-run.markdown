When there is such a demand for whiskey, it only makes sense that distilleries release new products and even more boutique distilleries start popping up. Though most smaller brands are owned by larger brands (see our post about this [here](http://www.tastersclub.com/blog/bourbon-family-tree.html) smaller, boutique distilleries are beginning to make their own space in the market. We've put together a few that you may want to try.

While not *at all* a boutique distillery, Diageo recently released two great new bottles under the name <a href="http://whiskyadvocate.com/whisky/2014/01/29/diageos-orphan-barrel-whiskey-project/" rel='nofollow'>Orphan Barrel Whiskey Distillery</a>. They are the Barterhouse, Old Blowhard and Rhetoric, all of which are true bourbons and are receiving solid reviews. 

Barterhouse tends to be softer, reminiscent of warm spice, biscuit and buttercream and is expected to be priced at $75. Old Blowhard is aged for 26 years and contains rich flavors with undertones of smoke and honey with a gentle finish and is expected to be sold at $150.

Also, a noteworty metnion is <a href="http://www.proximospirits.com/tincup.html" rel='nofollow'>Tincup</a>. While it's bottled in Colorado, it's actually made in Indiana. Because it's made with blend of corn, rye and malt, and cut with Colorado's Rocky Mountain water, Tincup's high rye content gives it a spicier flavor than most bourbons and it's also more affordable at only $27 per bottle.

Want to try something different? <a href="http://www.copperrundistillery.com/" rel="nofollow">Copper Run Distillery</a> is taking whiskey making to the next level and are happy to present the "Overproof" Ozark Mountain Moonshine. Coming in at a heavy 120 proof and with flavors of sweet buttery corn, toasted wheat and caramelized barley, it's a unique taste. Some folks will say that moonshine doesn't stack up next to a true bourbon since it's lacking the oak influence via barrel aging, it's interesting to give it a try and see what whiskey is like without the oaky quality.

Here at <a href="http://www.tastersclub.com">Taster's Club</a>, we look to bring you some of the unique flavors that you may not be able to find unless you were local. We take pride in selecting interesting and unique scotch and bourbon each month to make sure you always receive something different and you'll also be able to learn all about where it comes from!

Enjoy. And, as always: <a href="mailto:info@tastersclub.com?subject=Feedback!">let us know if you have any feedback!</a>
