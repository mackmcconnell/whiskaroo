Fall is approaching and that means warm desserts, time with family and friends and rich flavors! Cooking with Bourbon adds a unique twist to any dish that you’re making and we wanted to share an amazing Peach Bourbon Pie with Bacon Brown Sugar Crumble from Food For My Family. Is your mouth already watering? We figured.

This is the perfect dessert to make for family and friends, bring to a tailgate or enjoy with Sunday night dinner. The sweetness of the peaches and the spicy bourbon goes perfectly with the crunchy bacon without being overpowering of one single flavor.

> ###Peach Bourbon Pie with Bacon Brown Sugar Crumble
> Start with a 1 9′′ pie crust dough

> *For the filling:*

> + 6 cups sliced peaches
> + 1/2 cup brown sugar
> + 2 tablespoons bourbon
> + 2 tablespoons quick cooking tapioca (not pearls) 
> + 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
> + 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

> *For the crumble:*

> + 4 slices bacon
> + 1/2 cup brown sugar
> + 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
> + 1 vanilla bean, scraped
> + 4 tablespoons softened butter


Preheat oven to 375° F. Roll out the pie dough and fit + in a 9′′ pie plate, crimping the edges as desired. Place in the refrigerator to stay cool while you prepare the filling and crumble.

Place the peaches in a large bowl. Add the brown sugar, bourbon, tapioca, lemon juice, and vanilla. Toss to coat the peaches thoroughly.

Cook the bacon over medium heat in a skillet until crisp. Remove the strips from the pan and set aside on a paper towel to drain. Reserve the grease. In a bowl, combine the brown sugar, flour, vanilla bean seeds, butter, and the bacon grease. Cut together with a fork until crumbly. Break the bacon slices into small pieces and add it to the crumble.

Remove the pie crust from the refrigerator. Pour in the peach filling, and then spread the crumble topping evenly across the top of the pie.
￼￼
Bake for 10 minutes at 375° F, then reduce the heat to 350° F and bake for an additional 40-45 minutes or until the top and edges of the crust are golden brown. Cool slightly before serving.

Makes 8-10 servings.

Enjoy!
