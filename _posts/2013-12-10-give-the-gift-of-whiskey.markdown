Everyone knows how hard it is to shop for the men in your life. Whether it's your dad, boyfriend or best friend, men are typically difficult to shop for. Add in Christmas traffic, packed malls, long lines and screaming kids and your patience is worn thin. That's not the jolly Christmas shopping experience you should have. It's also hard to shop for special and unique gifts that will actually continued to be used throughout the year. Yes, you could opt for tools, another stiff work shirt or the somewhat thoughtless gift certificate, but why not do something a little different this year.


Get your guy a gift he'll enjoy for the next few months, will impress his friends and is both unique and interesting. A membership to the Taster's Club is the gift that keeps on giving throughout the upcoming year and your man will love the uniqueness of this Membership. Whether you opt for the 3 month, 6 month or as long as you would like, your guy will be receiving a full sized bottle of Whiskey or Scotch each month. With Taster's Club, he's not going to get a few little bottles that barely allow for a full glass, he'll be able to enjoy a full bottle and even can share with family and friends. The other aspect of being a member is that he will also receive an educational piece emailed to him with information all about the specific bottle of the month including where it's from, how it's aged and more about the distillery. 


This gift will be a favorite for quite a few reasons. It keeps giving well after Christmas. Come January and the following months, he'll look forward to what will be arriving in the mail and what the offering of the month will be. It also increases his collection of spirits while teaching him a few things about each month's offering , great for a tasting party or just having a small gathering with friends. It's also a gift that any guy would love to have, even if he doesn't know it exists yet. 


A membership to the Taster's Club will be the easiest gift you've bought this year as it's available at the click of the mouse. Need something last minute? We've got you taken care of. So grab your favorite cocktail, pull up a chair and get your holiday shopping done in the blink of an eye. Welcome to the <a href="http://www.tastersclub.com">Taster's Club</a>.
