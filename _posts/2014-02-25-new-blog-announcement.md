##Sires of Scotch, Barons of Bourbon,

Over the last few weeks, we’ve been working to revamp our blog. Today, we share it with you - hope you enjoy the facelift!

As usual, we’re going to continue to bring you awesome content about one of your favourite topics: whiskey and everything revolving around it: whether it’s something we’ve sent out for our [bourbon of the month club](http://www.tastersclub.com/blog/september-bourbon-of-the-month-hillrock-solera.html) or scotch of the month club, [food](http://www.tastersclub.com/blog/peach-bourbon-pie.html) and [cocktail](http://www.tastersclub.com/blog/pumpkin-spice-milkshake-breckenridge-bourbon.html) recipes or generally interesting tidbits about whiskey, we’ve got you covered. 

If you make the (awesome!) decision to become a member of Taster’s Club by picking up one of our [plans](http://www.tastersclub.com/offers) that suits you best, not only will you monthly receive a great, selected bottle of bourbon or scotch but in addition we’ll enroll you in our Whiskey 101 course filled with plenty of informational material, including whiskey profiles, tasting notes, style guide, production techniques and more. You’ll soon become an expert and amaze your entourage at any party!

See something you dig? Don’t hesitate to share our blog posts by clicking on the “share this” button, just below the title. 

Have a nice week, whiskey fans, and stay tuned to the blog for tasty stuff coming to you soon!
